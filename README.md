# Portfolio

My (current) personal developer portfolio and development blog - I'm hoping to actually start writing again after so long now that i've settled on a decent workflow.

### What's it built with

Plenty of other peoples sweat and tears.. I've just did the easy part of putting what i wanted all together on top of the great work of others

- Gatsby (Based off the Gatsby blog starter template)
- Netfliy CMS
- GraphQL
- TypeScript
