Urban is the UK's leading at home wellness platform, connecting wellness professionals and their customers via our bespoke web platform and apps.

Currently, as the Lead Frontend Engineer at Urban, I'm responsible for developing, overseeing and guiding the team on the development of our 5 web-based platforms, which include everything from e-commerce to live streaming video platforms. Our main frontend stack consists of Node Express, React, NextJs, Typescript and MobX.

Alongside my role as Lead Frontend, I also act as a team lead and technical lead for our B2B platform which enables companies to book, enrol and manage their employees access to bespoke in-office wellness treatments from their browser.

As B2B team lead, I work across our Javascript based stack including our Node microservice backend while also officiating the usual Agile ceremonies, working closely with other stakeholders in the business to plan and architect solutions and features.

The team lead position involves working closely alongside our CTO and other senior team members helping to ensure that the whole product team is working towards a similar goal while directing and advising on how features should be implemented and how as a team we can improve efficiently and scalably.
