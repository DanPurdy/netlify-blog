PrimaryBid aims to give everyone fair access to IPOs and public company fundraises, at the same time and price as institutional investors.

As a Senior Engineering Manager, I originally led two of our platform teams while also supporting the wider engineering team. I focused on making sure our teams were working effectively together while also working closely with our product team to ensure that the right work is being delivered. I contributed to the overall design of our system, direction of the platform and still managed to commit the odd bit of code too.
