 You killed my fada. I'll be back. No sequel for you. Allow me to break the ice.

 Traffic. Screw you! The iceman cometh... I'll live to see you eat that contract. Grant me revenge. I don't do requests. Fugettit, i'm not going to sit on your lap.

 If it bleeds, we can kill it. It's not a tumor. What the hell are you? I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions. Knock knock. Allow me to break the ice. Stop being such a pussy.

 Let off some steam bennet. Bring your toy back to the carpet. Back to the carpet.
