Since launching in 2013, the company has grown into a global leader in personalised publishing, and in June 2025 it joined the Penguin Random House group (working closely with DK) while continuing to operate with its own culture and brand. Wonderbly also owns Historic Newspapers (historic-newspapers.com).
